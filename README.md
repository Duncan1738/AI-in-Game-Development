# 🎮 AI in Game Development

This project explores **AI-driven game development**, focusing on:
- **NPC Behavior** – Simulated non-player character movement.
- **Procedural Content Generation** – AI-generated game environments.
- **Basic AI Model** – NPC decision-making using a simple neural network.

## 📌 Features
✅ **AI NPC Movement** – NPCs move randomly and adapt based on AI decisions.  
✅ **Procedural Terrain Generation** – Generates random maps using noise functions.  
✅ **Deep Learning for AI Behavior** – NPC movement powered by a basic neural network.  
✅ **Pygame for Visualization** – Runs in a simple game loop.  

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ **Install Dependencies**
Run this in **Google Colab** or your local environment:
```bash
pip install pygame numpy tensorflow

2️⃣ Run the AI Game Simulation
Run the Python script to see:

NPCs moving intelligently.
A procedurally generated terrain.
3️⃣ Modify AI NPC Behavior
Edit create_npc_ai() to experiment with different AI movement patterns.

📌 Future Enhancements
✅ Train AI to Learn from Player Movements
✅ Generate More Complex Maps with Perlin Noise
✅ Integrate Reinforcement Learning for Smarter NPCs
