# AI-Powered NPC Game with Procedural Terrain

This project is an **AI-powered NPC movement simulation** built with **Pygame** and **TensorFlow**. The game features **procedurally generated terrain**, AI-controlled **NPCs**, and **obstacle avoidance**. It runs smoothly in **Google Colab** by capturing frames and generating a **GIF animation**.
---
##  Features
-  **Procedural Terrain Generation** using **Perlin Noise**.
-  **AI-driven NPC Movement** trained with **TensorFlow**.
-  **NPC Sprite Support** (or fallback to a default shape if unavailable).
-  **Obstacle Avoidance** to prevent NPCs from walking into blocked areas.
-  **GIF-based Animation** to visualize game progress in Google Colab.
---
##  Installation
This project is designed to run in **Google Colab**. If running locally, ensure you have **Python 3.11+**.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:
```sh
!apt-get update
!apt-get install -y python-opengl ffmpeg
!pip install pygame numpy tensorflow noise imageio requests
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-NPC-Game.git
cd AI-NPC-Game
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the main.py script (or execute in Google Colab).

##  Installation
Since Google Colab does not support live Pygame rendering, the game:

Generates terrain and AI-driven NPC movement.
Saves multiple frames as images.
Creates a GIF animation for visualization.
To run the game in Google Colab:

from google.colab import files
files.upload()  # Upload main.py and required files

!python main.py

 How It Works
The AI model is trained to predict NPC movements.
The terrain is generated using Perlin noise.
NPCs move strategically, avoiding red obstacle areas.
A GIF is generated instead of real-time rendering.
 Expected Output
The final output will be an animated GIF showing NPCs moving intelligently across the procedural terrain.


 To-Do / Improvements
 Add real-time keyboard controls for a player-controlled NPC.
 Improve NPC AI using reinforcement learning.
 Enhance terrain generation for more natural landscapes.
 Implement pathfinding (A*) for smarter NPC movement.
